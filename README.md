- Manage pricing and service descriptions

## üåê API Endpoints

The application provides RESTful JSON endpoints:

- **GET /api/autorepaircenters** - List all auto repair centers
- **GET /api/autorepaircenters/{id}** - Get a specific auto repair center
- **GET /api/autorepaircenters/{id}/container** - List all items in a center
- **GET /api/autorepaircenters/{id}/container/{item_id}** - Get a specific item

## üöÄ Development & Deployment

### Development Environment

For developers, we recommend using Vagrant to ensure consistent development environments:

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
python app.py
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, consider:

- Using a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn
- Configuring a reverse proxy with Nginx
- Using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
- Setting up HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
- Implementing proper logging
